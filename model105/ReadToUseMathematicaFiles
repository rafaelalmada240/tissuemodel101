AnalyticalExpressionOrderParameterWoundClosure - to derive the mean field dimensionless expression
RootExploration1 - To visualize the roots in function of different parameters
RootExploration2 - An attempt to analytically explore the interplay of actin-tension and tissue fluidity in wound closure
StabilityAnalysisSimplifiedModel - Visualizes phase portraits of a simplified version of the model to recover some of the dynamics to be expected
StabilityAnalysisOffE - Explores the original not Taylor Expanded model in order to recover the dynamical properties of the system, what kind of bifurcations are present in the system
SusceptibilityAndMeanFieldVariables - Some quantities like heat capacity and susceptibility as well as critical exponents are computed to justify the mean field approach
