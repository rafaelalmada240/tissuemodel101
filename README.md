# tissuemodel101
A repository for code I am currently using in my PhD project

In folder model101, I have the code to implement the vertex model in a random tissue (with no wound) to a finite gradient method.

In folder model102, I have the code to implement the vertex model in a random tissue with wound to a finite gradient method, with equal equilibrium area for all cells.
