NOTE WHEN GENERATED MULTIPLE-CELL WOUNDS:
Before doing simulations it is recommended to first open the tissue in GeneratedTissueVisualization for manual edits. The primary edits required involve 
A - Manually remove extra vertices in wound border (not from the dataset, but from any regions and edges where they may be present)
Can't leave blank edges, but can delete them; Can leave blank vertices and cells, but can't delete vertices. This ensures all inner vertices have 3 neighbours and that the wound is convex
B - Fix the boundary if there are any visible issues with it.
